# HR Attrition Dashboard
## Project Objective
This project is an interactive HR Attrition Dashboard built entirely using Microsoft Excel. It visualizes key HR metrics such as attrition rate, employee demographics, job roles, performance, and more. The dashboard enables HR professionals to quickly identify trends and make data-driven decisions to reduce employee turnover.
